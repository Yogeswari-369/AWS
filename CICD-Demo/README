Step 1 : Set Up GitHub Repository

The first step is to set up a GitHub repository to store our Python application's source code. 

- Go to github.com and sign in to your account.
- Click on the "+" button in the top-right corner and select "New repository."
- Give your repository a name and an optional description.
- Choose the appropriate visibility option based on your needs.
- Initialize the repository with a README file.
- Click on the "Create repository" button to create your new GitHub repository.
- Great! Now that we have our repository set up, we can move on to the next step.
